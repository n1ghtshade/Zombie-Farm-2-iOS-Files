# Zombie-Farm-2-Files

 Zombie Farm v2.25 Game Files from iOS .ipa

Contents:


    iTunesArtwork

The Payload/ folder contains the actual app binary along with all of its resources that it needs to function. Once inside the Payoad/ folder, there will be a single file with the “.app” extension. This file is actually just another folder, and you can open it like any other folder. On MacOS, right click it and press “Show Package Contents”.
